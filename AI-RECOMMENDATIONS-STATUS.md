# AI Recommendations System - Fixed Migration Issues

## What Was Fixed:

### Problem 1: user_behaviors table
- `session_id` was 255 characters
- Combined with `behavior_type` (50 chars) exceeded MySQL 1000-byte index limit
- **Fixed**: Reduced `session_id` to 100 characters

### Problem 2: product_recommendations table  
- Same issue with `session_id` field being 255 characters
- **Fixed**: Reduced `session_id` to 100 characters
- **Fixed**: Added explicit names for unique constraints to avoid auto-generated long names

## Current Migration Status:

Both tables now have optimal field sizes:
- `session_id(100)` + `behavior_type(50)` = 150 chars × 4 bytes = 600 bytes ✅
- `session_id(100)` + `recommendation_type(50)` = 150 chars × 4 bytes = 600 bytes ✅

## To Complete Setup:

1. Run: `php artisan migrate:fresh` 
2. Test the system with: `run-fresh-migration.bat`
3. Visit product pages to generate behavior data
4. Call AI recommendation endpoints
